Basic momentum trading agent written in python.
A momentum-based index trading system buys when the index shows strong upward price momentum
and sells (or shorts) when momentum weakens or turns negative. It uses indicators like relative momentum 
and moving averages aiming to ride strength while managing risk with stops and position sizing.
Versions exhibiting much better performance exist, but are not public at this time.
